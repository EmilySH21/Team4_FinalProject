            <p class="heading">Our mission</p>
            <p>Our mission is to advocate for animals by providing safety until home placement
                of those in our care. We promote spay and neuter programs as a means to control pet
                overpopulation.
            </p>
            <p class="heading">Wish list</p>
            <p>We always have a long shopping list at the Shelter! Donated items can be dropped off at the 
                shelter located at 56 Broad Street in Quincy during adoption hours and left with any of
                our Volunteers or shipped directly to us from Amazon. Check out our wish list!
            </p>
            <p class="heading">Volunteer</p>
            <p>Volunteers are the backbone of our efforts to improve the lives of the animals in our care. You 
                can also become a guardian angel and sponsor a cage or kennel at the shelter. You can become a 
                member of QAS or help out with one of our available positions at QAS.
